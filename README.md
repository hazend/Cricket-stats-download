# Cricket-stats-download
+ A Python program for fetching and downloading cricket data from the web.

+ statsguru aka https://stats.espncricinfo.com is amazing for all the stats related to the game of cricket. But it sucks that one cannot download the data from their website as a csv or excel etc file. This python program is a web scrapper that visits the website, fetches the data from the table and saves it as a csv file on the system.

+ Currently works only for Men's test batting stats.
